# Deployment Steps
1. Project Setup

    Clone the source code from the GitHub repository.

    Install dependencies using npm install or yarn install.

2. Environment Configuration

    Create a .env file to store environment variables such as API keys (Gemini AI, Clerk), database connection strings (NeonDB), and Inngest credentials.

3. Database Setup

    Set up the database using NeonDB.

    Use Prisma to define database schemas and models (prisma/schema.prisma).

    Run migrations with npx prisma migrate dev.

4. Authentication Integration

    Configure Clerk authentication by linking your Clerk account and setting up API keys in the .env file.

    Implement authentication flows in the project.

5. Backend Setup

    Configure APIs for user onboarding, resume building, and AI-powered insights.

    Integrate Inngest for cron jobs (e.g., weekly insights).

6. Frontend Development

    Build components using Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS.

    Implement pages such as landing page, onboarding page, interview preparation page, and resume builder.

7. AI Integration

    Set up Gemini AI API for generating industry insights and mock interview questions.

    Ensure proper error handling for API calls.

8. Testing

    Test all functionalities locally to ensure smooth operation (authentication, database interactions, API calls).

9. Deployment

    Deploy the application on platforms like Vercel or Netlify for frontend hosting.

    Use NeonDB for database hosting.

    Configure backend services (e.g., Inngest functions) on appropriate cloud platforms.

10. Post-Deployment Checks

    Verify all features are working correctly in production.

    Monitor logs and performance metrics to ensure scalability.
